        <h1>Rank My Major</h1>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to Rank My Major! There is a lot of stress and confusion when it comes to picking a major. I hope that with the responses to the survey below, we can all make the process easier for those who are still trying to decide!</p>
        <h2>The Pillars</h2>
        <p>The pillars that we will focus on in order to rank majors are:</p>
        <li>Percent of graduates that got jobs in their field of study?</li>
        <li>What was the difficulty of the major?</li>
        <li>Would you recommend that others pursue your degree?</li>
